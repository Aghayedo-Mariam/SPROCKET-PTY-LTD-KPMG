# SPROCKET-PTY-LTD-KPMG

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on since completing the KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship. I had the privilege of diving into the sales datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization.

One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was the opportunity to explore the data and formulate my own questions for visualization. It's a new skill I've developed - being able to create meaningful visualizations without explicit instructions on what the company wants to see.

The datasets included customer addresses, customer demographics, and transaction lists. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd approached Tony Smith, a Partner in KPMGâ€™s Lighthouse & Innovation Team, to leverage KPMG's expertise in Analytics, Information, and Modeling. Smith discussed how our team could effectively analyze these datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

Our primary focus was on customer and transaction data. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd had a substantial dataset related to its customers, but they were unsure how to harness it for optimizing their marketing strategy.

To guide our analysis, I sought insights from the Associate Director, who emphasized the critical importance of data quality. As the saying goes, "The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you have to drive company growth."

In response to the challenge, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd provided KPMG with three key datasets:

1. Customer Addresses
2. Customer Demographics
3. Transaction Lists
